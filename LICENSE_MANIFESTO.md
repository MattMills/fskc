I do not like the patent system. I believe it has been weaponized by corporations into a system of corporate nukes, used solely to stifle innovation and harass small competitors out of existence. I also do not particularly like capitalism as it stands. As per Marc Andreessen (https://futurism.com/marc-andreessen-america-hating-communists), this might qualify me as an "America-Hating communist." Personally, I prefer the term "socio-capitalist"—I believe capitalism's success depends on empowering consumers, not oligarchs.

We should construct feedback loops that meet basic human needs (food, clothing, shelter) while cycling value through the economy as efficiently as possible. By providing everyone with the means to afford necessities, we expand personal welfare, support value creation, and enable small businesses to thrive. This approach avoids relying on "trickle-down" economics, which often feels more like a golden shower from on high.
